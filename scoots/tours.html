            <h3>The Island of Cozumel...</h3>
            <p>Cozumel is an island located in the Caribbean Sea. It is 29 miles long and approximately 9 miles wide.
                The island is also the biggest of the Mexico inhabited islands. The island is covered in lots of green,
                as it is covered in vegetation making it a beautiful jungle. The island is surrounded by beautiful clear
                ocean waters, where breath taking coral reefs and marine life are found. The easy access to water allows
                for many water sports, fishing, and other fun activites at the beach. During the Mayan period, the
                island was full of many different prehistory sites. When the time of the Spanish Coloniel era came
                about, the population of the island of Cozumel was very minscule. During this time it is known that the
                island was used primarly for trading between ships, and a place that pirates commonly went to find
                shelter during storms and bad weather.</p>
